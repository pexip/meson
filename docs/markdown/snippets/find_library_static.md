## Add keyword `static` to `find_library`

`find_library` has learned the `static` keyword. They keyword must be a boolean,
where `true` only searches for static libraries and `false` only searches for
dynamic/shared. Leaving the keyword unset will keep the old behavior of first
searching for dynamic and then falling back to static.
